	<h1>The Most Interesting Places to Visit</h1>

	<p>Planning new adventures as a new year approaches is always a thrill, but finding the best places to visit in 2022 is unique. After two years of border closures, cruise cancellations, and travel restrictions galore, 2022 is the year we hope to get back out there, uninhibited (albeit vaccinated and COVID tested), return to our favorite destinations, and cross new ones off our lists.

Though the hospitality industry was hit hard by the pandemic, many properties used the forced downtime to renovate rooms, add new amenities, and expand outdoor spaces to offer even more once guests return. 2022 is when many travelers will venture further from home, and even overseas, for the first time since the start of the pandemic, finally reaping the benefits of these valiant efforts. <br>
Although COVID variants remain, regulations are still evolving, and precautions must still be taken, many of the destinations we chose for 2022 offer what we believe travelers are looking for in a post-pandemic world, from hotels with private accommodations to destinations teeming with fresh-air activities. Others, like Las Vegas, are for those who are ready and raring to make up for all the social time they missed â€” with a few splashy headliners, including Adele and the Raiders, thrown in for good measure. <br>
So if you're looking for a fun place to visit that isn't overcrowded with tourists, look no further!</p>

		<h2><a href="okinawa/okinawa.html">Okinawa, Japan</a></h2>
		<p>Okinawa is an archipelago (Okinawa Islands) located in the southern tip of Japan, with the central city of Naha located on the main island of Okinawa, surrounded by Kerama Island, Kume Island, Miyako Islands and Yaeyama Islands. Although this archipelago is quite strange to the Vietnamese people, it is so familiar to foreign tourists, especially Taiwan (because Taiwan is very close to Okinawa, it is very easy to fly by plane). Visitors often come here for their summer vacations, bathing because the sea is very beautiful sea with white sandy beaches, clear blue water. </p>
